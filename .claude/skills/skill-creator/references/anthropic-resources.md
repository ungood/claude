## The Progressive Disclosure System

**Core Design Principle**: Skills load information in stages as
needed, rather than consuming context upfront.

### The 3-Level Loading System

| Level | File | Context Window | Token Budget | When Loaded |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| **1** | SKILL.md Metadata (YAML) | Always loaded | ~100 tokens | At startup |
| **2** | SKILL.md Body (Markdown) | Loaded when skill triggers | \<5k tokens | When relevant |
| **3+** | Bundled files (references/, scripts/, assets/) | Loaded as needed by Claude | Unlimited\* | On-demand |

\*No practical limit - files only load when accessed

### Why This Matters

> "Like a well-organized manual that starts with a table of contents,
> then specific chapters, and finally a detailed appendix, skills let
> Claude load information only as needed."
>
> — Anthropic Engineering Blog

**Benefits**:

- You can install many skills without context penalty
- Claude only knows each skill exists and when to use it (Level 1)
- Detailed content doesn't consume tokens until needed
- Effectively unbounded context per skill (via Level 3)

______________________________________________________________________

## How Skills Work

### Skill Discovery and Loading

1. **Startup**: Claude pre-loads `name` and `description` of every
   installed skill into system prompt
2. **User request**: User makes a request that might need a skill
3. **Skill matching**: Claude scans available skills to find relevant
   matches
4. **Skill loading**: If relevant, Claude reads SKILL.md from
   filesystem via bash
5. **On-demand access**: Claude reads additional files (references/,
   scripts/) as needed

### The Filesystem Architecture

Skills run in a code execution environment where Claude has:

- **Filesystem access**: Skills exist as directories on a virtual
  machine
- **Bash commands**: Claude uses bash to read files and execute
  scripts
- **Code execution**: Scripts run without loading code into context

**How Claude accesses content**:

```bash
# Claude triggers skill by reading SKILL.md
bash: cat pdf-skill/SKILL.md

# Claude reads additional references if needed
bash: cat pdf-skill/references/forms.md

# Claude executes scripts (only output enters context)
bash: node pdf-skill/scripts/validate_form.js
```

**Key insight**: Script code never enters the context window. Only the
output does. This makes scripts far more token-efficient than
generating equivalent code on the fly.

## Official Best Practices

From Anthropic's engineering team:

### 1. Start with Evaluation

> "Identify specific gaps in your agents' capabilities by running them
> on representative tasks and observing where they struggle or require
> additional context. Then build skills incrementally to address these
> shortcomings."

**Process**:

- Use Claude on real tasks
- Notice where it struggles
- Create skills to fill gaps
- Test and iterate

### 2. Structure for Scale

> "When the SKILL.md file becomes unwieldy, split its content into
> separate files and reference them."

**Guidelines**:

- Keep SKILL.md under ~5k words
- Split mutually exclusive contexts into separate files
- Use code for both execution and documentation
- Make it clear whether Claude should run or read scripts

### 3. Think from Claude's Perspective

> "Monitor how Claude uses your skill in real scenarios and iterate
> based on observations: watch for unexpected trajectories or
> overreliance on certain contexts."

**Key areas**:

- `name` and `description` drive skill triggering
- Claude decides whether to use the skill based on metadata
- Observe actual usage patterns, not assumed ones

### 4. Iterate with Claude

> "As you work on a task with Claude, ask Claude to capture its
> successful approaches and common mistakes into reusable context and
> code within a skill."

**Workflow**:

1. Work on task with Claude
2. Notice successful patterns
3. Ask Claude to capture them in skill
4. Test and refine

## Writing for Claude

### Skills as "Onboarding Guides"

> "Building a skill for an agent is like putting together an
> onboarding guide for a new hire."
>
> — Anthropic Engineering Blog

**What this means**:

- Focus on procedural knowledge ("how to do X")
- Include workflows, not just facts
- Provide examples of actual usage
- Capture organizational context

### Skills Transform General → Specialized Agents

> "Skills extend Claude's capabilities by packaging your expertise
> into composable resources for Claude, transforming general-purpose
> agents into specialized agents that fit your needs."

**Examples**:

- General Claude + Database skill = Database specialist
- General Claude + Auth skill = Security specialist
- General Claude + UI skill = Frontend specialist

______________________________________________________________________

## The Skill Anatomy

### Required Structure

Every skill must have:

```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md          # Required
```

SKILL.md must have:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: What it does and when to use it
---

# Skill content...
```

### Frontmatter Limits

| Field | Limit | Required |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| `name` | 64 characters | Yes |
| `description` | 1024 characters | Yes |

Only `name` and `description` are supported. No other YAML fields.

### Optional Bundled Content

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md                    # Level 2: Instructions
├── references/                 # Level 3: Documentation
│   ├── detailed-guide.md
│   └── api-reference.md
├── scripts/                    # Level 3: Executable code
│   ├── validate.js
│   └── generate.sh
└── assets/                     # Level 3: Resources
    ├── template.json
    └── diagram.png
```

______________________________________________________________________

## Context Window Behavior

### How the Context Window Changes

From Anthropic's documentation:

**Initial state**:

```
[System Prompt]
[Skill 1 Metadata]
[Skill 2 Metadata]
[Skill N Metadata]
[User Message]
```

**After skill triggers**:

```
[System Prompt]
[Skill Metadata (all skills)]
[User Message]
[SKILL.md Body]              ← Loaded via bash
[references/forms.md]        ← Loaded as needed
```

**Key point**: Metadata for ALL skills is always loaded. Only
triggered skills load their SKILL.md body.

______________________________________________________________________

## Progressive Disclosure in Practice

### Example: PDF Skill

**Level 1 (Always):**

```yaml
name: pdf
description:
  Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents.
  Use when working with PDF files.
```

~100 tokens

**Level 2 (When triggered):**

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick Start

Use pdfplumber to extract text...

For form filling, see [forms.md](forms.md)
```

~3k tokens

**Level 3 (As needed):**

- `references/forms.md` - Form-filling guide (only if filling forms)
- `scripts/extract_fields.js` - Executable script (runs, doesn't load)

**Total token cost if NOT filling forms**: ~3,100 tokens (Level 1 +
Level 2) **Total token cost if filling forms**: ~6,000 tokens (Level
1 + Level 2 + forms.md)

______________________________________________________________________

## Code Execution in Skills

### Why Include Scripts

> "Large language models excel at many tasks, but certain operations
> are better suited for traditional code execution. For example,
> sorting a list via token generation is far more expensive than
> simply running a sorting algorithm."
>
> — Anthropic Engineering Blog

**When to use scripts**:

- **Efficiency**: Operations that are cheaper to execute than generate
- **Determinism**: Tasks requiring consistent, repeatable results
- **Complexity**: Algorithms better suited to code than token
  generation

### Script Execution Model

```bash
# Claude runs script
bash: node scripts/validate_form.js form.pdf

# Output (only this enters context)
✅ All form fields valid
Found 12 fillable fields
```

**Context consumed**: ~20 tokens (just the output) **Alternative
(Claude generates validation code)**: ~500 tokens

**50x more efficient**

## Security Considerations

From Anthropic's security guidelines:

### Trusted Sources Only

> "We strongly recommend using Skills only from trusted sources: those
> you created yourself or obtained from Anthropic."

**Risk**: Malicious skills can:

- Direct Claude to invoke tools in harmful ways
- Execute code with unintended effects
- Exfiltrate data to external systems
- Compromise system security

### Auditing Third-Party Skills

If you must use untrusted skills:

1. **Review all files**: SKILL.md, scripts, images, bundled resources
2. **Check for unusual patterns**:
   - Unexpected network calls
   - File access beyond skill scope
   - Operations not matching stated purpose
3. **Examine external sources**: Skills fetching from URLs are risky
4. **Verify dependencies**: Check code dependencies and imports

### Runtime Constraints

Skills run in the code execution container with:

- ❌ **No network access**: Cannot make external API calls
- ❌ **No runtime package installation**: Only pre-installed packages
  available
- ✅ **Sandboxed execution**: Isolated from host system

______________________________________________________________________

## Skills are Composable

> "Skills stack together. Claude automatically identifies which skills
> are needed and coordinates their use."
>
> — Anthropic Product Announcement

### Example: Multi-Skill Task

**User request**: "Create a GitHub contact card with database-backed
favorites"

**Skills activated**:

1. `github-integration` - Fetch profile data
2. `database-patterns` - Query favorites table
3. `ui-components` - Build card component
4. `styling-patterns` - Apply CSS/styles

**Result**: Skills work together naturally, each handling its domain.

______________________________________________________________________

## Where Skills Work

### Claude.ai

- **Pre-built Skills**: PowerPoint, Excel, Word, PDF (automatic)
- **Custom Skills**: Upload as zip (Settings > Features)
- **Sharing**: Individual user only (not org-wide)

### Claude API

- **Pre-built Skills**: Reference by `skill_id` (e.g., `pptx`, `xlsx`)
- **Custom Skills**: Upload via `/v1/skills` endpoints
- **Sharing**: Workspace-wide

### Claude Code

- **Custom Skills only**: Filesystem-based (`.claude/skills/` or
  `~/.claude/skills/`)
- **Sharing**: Via git/version control

**Important**: Skills don't sync across surfaces. Upload separately
for each platform.

## Future of Skills

From Anthropic:

> "Looking further ahead, we hope to enable agents to create, edit,
> and evaluate Skills on their own, letting them codify their own
> patterns of behavior into reusable capabilities."

**Coming soon**:

- Simplified skill creation workflows
- Enterprise-wide deployment
- Skills complement MCP for complex workflows
- Agents creating their own skills

## Key Quotes

### On Progressive Disclosure

> "Progressive disclosure is the core design principle that makes
> Agent Skills flexible and scalable."

### On Simplicity

> "Skills are a simple concept with a correspondingly simple format.
> This simplicity makes it easier for organizations, developers, and
> end users to build customized agents and give them new
> capabilities."

### On Filesystem Architecture

> "Agents with a filesystem and code execution tools don't need to
> read the entirety of a skill into their context window when working
> on a particular task. This means that the amount of context that can
> be bundled into a skill is effectively unbounded."

### On Purpose

> "Think of Skills as custom onboarding materials that let you package
> expertise, making Claude a specialist on what matters most to you."
