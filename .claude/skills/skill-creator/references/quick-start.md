# Quick Start Guide

## Creating Your First Skill

1. **Create the skill directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-skill
   ```

2. **Create SKILL.md with frontmatter**

   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my-skill
   description: Brief description of what this skill does
   ---

   # My Skill

   Core instructions go here...
   ```

3. **Test in conversation**

   - Invoke the skill using the Skill tool
   - Verify it loads and provides correct guidance

4. **Iterate and expand**

   - Add references/ directory for detailed documentation
   - Add scripts/ for executable operations
   - Add assets/ for templates and files

## Skill Structure Details

### Directory Layout

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Core instructions + YAML frontmatter
├── references/       # Detailed documentation (loaded as needed)
│   ├── guide.md
│   └── examples.md
├── scripts/          # Executable shell scripts or programs
│   └── setup.sh
└── assets/           # Templates, images, configuration files
    └── template.yaml
```

### SKILL.md Anatomy

```markdown

- Target: \<200 chars, \<30 tokens
- Used for: Skill discovery and triggering

### Level 2: Instructions (Loaded When Triggered)

- SKILL.md body content
- Target: \<50 lines, \<1000 words, \<680 tokens
- Contains: Core patterns, essential rules, reference links

### Level 3: Resources (Loaded On Demand)

- references/ scripts/ assets/ directories
- Size: Unlimited
- Contains: Detailed docs, code, templates

## Tips for Effective Skills

- **Start minimal**: Begin with just SKILL.md
- **Iterate**: Add references/ as complexity grows
- **Link clearly**: Use relative links to reference files
- **Test often**: Validate with `pnpx claude-skills-cli validate`
- **Stay focused**: One skill = one clear purpose
