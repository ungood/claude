# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.  This is a long line to test comrak.

## Project Overview

This repository is a Claude Code plugin marketplace containing a personal collection of plugins.

## Structure

- `.claude-plugin/` - Marketplace configuration
  - `marketplace.json` - Plugin marketplace manifest
- `plugins/` - Individual plugin directories

## Tenets

- Create the simplest plugin structure as you can.  Use minimal metadata and do not nest files in a .claude directory - this is not necessary.
